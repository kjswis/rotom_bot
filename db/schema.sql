So he tries to hang around them more often then others.	Obe City	He has an odd tendency to sleep walk on some occasions, and go in search of a snack to satisfy his gluttonous hunger in his slumber. He's also really possessive of any food he would be holding, and won't share it with anyone for any particular reason (With rare exceptions.).	SFW	f

Really they are super friendly... just very clumsy, tripping and falling over on a little pokemon, or rolling over them in his sleep. In a situation where the guild is tasked with retrieving pokemon from his rolls, he would be compliant, but would need convincing that the guild members aren't going to get lost too. Should guild members attempt to rescue the trapped pokemon without permission, he'd likely panic, which would cause the rescuer to be more likely of getting trapped too. The closest thing to a 'demand' he has is just requesting the rescuer be his friend in exchange for letting them rescue the lost pokemon. Really they are a friendly and gentle soul at heart.

Being the first, he actually lived on Sinnoh for a short time after his experimentation and was at their daycare too before trainers' mothers complained about him and his very well-endowed boner, thus him being sent at first to an uninhabited island near Alola alongside an Incineroar named Jess.	Due to the experimentations, he is able to devolve and evolve seemingly via emotional and sexual prowess. Submissive or rare playfulness usually devolves to Luxio, while scared devolves to Shinx, though this is very rare. In combat, he stays a Luxray and even has a mega evolution from the experimentation that gives a false shiny look should his temper flare up. He also has on a red speedo as well, which was a suggestion from a professor when the parental complaints started coming in for him.	?edit2=2_ABaOnudi-9vpAY5oJq7g61YrinDCJYYBt6g4dOAEFSUmQbUdVwnkQFlgZVqtl7Ll96ii8V8	Active	\N	\N	He does enjoy being a big inflated berry or balloon, even if he doesn't admit it. | He can cum for 24 full hours in a row and produce thousands of eggs with any pokemon. | He prioritizes breeding over fighting. | He has seemingly no limit to when enough was enough for sex, and usually needs a ear rub to be told when to quit.

She's usually a dominant figure, so she likes to be in control. This is why she usually goes on missions by herself instead of with a team. She loves ice cream and sweet tasting berries.	Amelia doesn't enjoy eating meat, but she wouldn't call herself a vegetarian. She dislikes loud and annoying children, overconfident Pokemon, and being called fat or chubby.	Friendly! Amelia is a super friendly Pokemon to work with, but try not to get in her way and mess up her plans. Usually her plans of action work, but in cases that they fail she usually puts the blame on another one of her teammates for fear of being laughed at.\nShe doesn't seem to have sinister intentions, but the fact that she keeps her laboratory a secret unnerves a lot of the folk who live there. She also seems to have a lot of money, and no one knows where it comes from.	Amelia grew up around technology, always fascinated by how things worked, and during her early childhood she excelled at speech and mathematics. As she grew a little older, she yearned to understand how evolution really worked and why it just happened at a certain point in a Pokemon's life. After saving up enough capital she purchased her own space to do research, starting off with how basic evolution worked. From her findings she felt compelled to study further into evolution until she remembered Mega Evolution. She was graciously given several Mega Stones by willing Pokemon who had found them, the Ampharos thinking that whatever caused evolution was trapped inside the stone casing. She used a laser cutter to saw each stone in half, discovering that each stone had liquid inside that could be compared to something like Quicksilver.	After a test for any toxic elements in the componds, Amelia thought that this liquid caused evolution no matter which Pokemon might come in contact with it, considering the fact that each stone had the same compound inside. After fully testing the mixture to make sure it was safe to consume, Amelia decided to try and drink it in order to see if it might trigger evolution! Well, she had been right... except the transformation was extremely painful since it had been triggered in the wrong way. The full transformation took hours, the Ampharos' bones cracking and changing to match the form she now sees herself in today. Since then, she threw away her old research and instead studies robotics, never to return back to her old research. As of now she lives somewhere in Larousse City, the location of her lab completely unknown to the public.	?edit2=2_ABaOnuds-NlMl6kZoG0-ekUj-jElmavOzOIqipAY9D0daNoYBI75wxycCZzdo4vuC2pN07c	Active	\N	\N	I see her come out of Larousse City a lot.

Irritating noises, overthinking, and being ignored.	Generally, Jared is a pretty chill type of person that simply hangs around, can be a bit loud at times, a little hard headed, and voices his opinion most of the time. He can be a bit rash when it comes to certain situations, as he's quick to act and rushes into them.	Not much is known about Jared's pre-teen years, but some thought that he must of had some form of training and practice when he was younger. With nothing more then a simple wooden staff, a training sword, and a blue scarf, he dove straight into taking on the world! Which was really just taking side jobs here and there, mostly just guarding travelers from point A to point B. He lived under an Ampharos named Kai for about a year or two after his sudden appearance, where he was taught cartography and strangely, how to read and write. If anyone were to look at his earlier maps, they would have noticed some writing near the sides or corners that seemed like notes, yet it looked like some other language or simple gibberish. His skills as a fighter were sharpened by Kai, as they were seen sparring against each other at least two to three times a week. At least, up until Jared left to start working as a cartographer and occasionally, a rescue or exploration team member.	Within the first year of starting at the Guild, he had been apart of multiple rescue team missions and was known to join a few exploration parties, almost always coming back with a map of the route and areas they went through. So far, he's only 'published' two full maps of the more obscured areas of a canyon and a overgrown forest, although there are some talks he's working on a third. His maps have been known to be so accurate that some claim he uses black magic and other demonic methods while others claim that he's honestly just really good at the job and actually gets some help from multiple Pokemon from the area, including flying and dragon types.	?edit2=2_ABaOnuehwolSG3e9sqVzak5eK8VAoIRuEMTRo_gT5GvLA7Gf6hmx65fQAw2n76-OvnPsgjg	Active	\N	\N	Some say Jared is such a good swordsman and fighter that he once almost defeated a Charizard in a sparring match and reached a draw in a fight against a Giratina. | It was speculated that Jared had some connections to one of the legendary Guardians of the Mystery Dungeon Universe, yet he's neither confirmed or denied the allegations | Because he seemingly appeared out of nowhere almost 3 years back, there are still talks about his origins.

Squall is usually one to make friends with anyone she meets, although you may not get full details on who or what exactly she is. She loves to be mysterious and weird, spooking those who may be a bit more susceptible to scares in order to have a quick harmless laugh. She can usually be seen talking to.. something, even when there is no one around to make conversation. In short, she could be described as "laid back" or "quirky".	Some say that Squall just sort of showed up one day, not even taking time to introduce herself. She asserted herself as being in the community for a good while before she was actually first seen, so some are debating her sanity and well being. Truth be told, she suddenly just came to be. The Deerling always totes around a large bag on her back, along with always carrying a sent of herbs and spices. She constantly looks tired and worn out, and seems to sometimes disappear in the blink of an eye. After reaching the age of 20 and a while of being a hermit in the forests, she came to town offering assistance to different teams and groups that needed it. Also, it's said that if you watch her closely, sometimes she can be seen eating strange glowing orbs out of jars.. coming from her bag she carries around.	\N	?edit2=2_ABaOnufbCe7jlYE-OFiCs8_F7wl7b6VQcRI3G7KXnGAXK7acqTZ0iMPmV3OSavIJYivD-BY	Inactive	\N	\N	Squall helps  Pokémon in need during harsh storms. | If you find her tent in the forest, she'll award you with some food and supplies. | She's secretly pushing her own evil agenda whilst helping others. | Squall is a little crazy. | Squall starves herself.	\N	\N	\N	f

Shyami is a very innocent and caring Pokemon, making sure to help wherever she is needed. Most find her very easy to talk to, and rely on her to keep up happy conversation when things get dire.	Shyami was born late into her parent's lives, making it hard for them to properly teach her the responsibility that came with who she was. After her parents left to continue their work, Shyami was left to roam the world in search of her purpose. She made many friends along the way, including that of a few other Legendary Pokemon. Her closest friend would most likely be the Mew who repeatedly helps her whenever she makes a mistake. Recently, she crossed over into a different world in order to search for more Pokemon she could assist. Soon enough however, she came across the local guild and requested that she join as an assistant to any team that needed help on their missions. She never asked to be on a specific team. All that mattered to her is that she got to help out those in need! Currently, she hangs around at the Guild, waiting to be asked for help.

Exceptionally generous!	Roy had a very easy childhood, one that he kind of regrets having, mainly because he feels that he didn't deserve all the privileges he had as a kid. For that reason, Roy made it his lifelong goal to give as much as he can to as many people as possible, mainly just to let others experience what his childhood felt like to him. It was constantly rewarding, never difficult. When he realized how easy he had it, he humbled himself so that others could feel the same way. Generosity aside, Roy takes pleasure in doing good and honest work for the community that calls itself home in Zaplana. He never misses the opportunity to help someone in need. As of present day, Roy owns a small farm just around the edge of Pudgeberry Forest, one that he uses to house weary travelers and give food to those who cannot find it on their own. He regularly bakes and carries his goods to town for purchase on the basis of 'Name your own price', mainly because some people can't afford the same exact price as anyone else.	He usually keeps at least one farm tool on him, usually a shovel since he finds it the most handy. (Note, he is also slightly southern. Never agressive unless prompted to an extreme level.)	?edit2=2_ABaOnuePJUkSHM2iIgP2XiTVLL7YQIWATgxb9FoxMqiJG4hzRis9b2XBomAKTCF6GTCSvHc	Active	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f

Though that's just how he acts in public.	Cecil is a Pancham whose early life was pretty nice. He had a caring mother and a caring father, Shui and Virgil Lee, who would go everywhere with him, taking as better care of him as they possibly could. One day as they were visiting a foreign region as a family, Virgil took his son with him as he was heading somewhere. Virgil was ambushed as he was returning home, leading to him perishing and leaving poor young Cecil all alone in a world that was new to him. He began wandering off on his own until he was found and taken to a nearby village, which is where he lived the rest of his life up until now.	As average as the average Pancham can be.

People who bully others, being waken up during one of his naps.	Jolly, has a smile on his face most of the time. A big sweetheart.	Theodore was never the brightest kid. When he was younger he'd often get made fun of at school due to the fact that he wasn't able to retain the stuff he was taught... He didn't really understand what all those insults meant at the time. He continued growing up, stuck in the same grade while everyone else moved on and graduated. He'd often get mocked by his fellow classmates due to being a bigger mon while still being stuck in the same grade as the younger ones. They'd call him lots of names, but Teddy never really knew what all those words meant, so he wasn't really hurt by it. His classmates would often compare him to a baby due to how dumb he was, and whatnot. He got called baby so much that eventually that was the name he was known with. They wouldn't call him Teddy, he was only Baby to all of them.	Teddy himself eventually learned the meaning of the word baby, and decided that if he was called baby so often then he MUST be a baby, right? He started showing up to school wearing diapers, which only made him a bigger target for everyone who wanted to make fun of him. Eventually he figured out that the words everyone used when referring to him were 'bad words,' and this ended up breaking his little heart. The next couple months were a complete hell for him now that he knew none of them really liked him. Then one day he had a sudden realization. He was a baby. And babies didn't have to attend school, did they? So one day he stopped showing up to his classes. No one at his school really missed him all that much when he did. When he stopped showing up however, Teddy felt... Happy. No one called him names anymore. He didn't have to deal with bullying. He was free! From that day onwards he became the happiest 'baby' ever, roaming around the world happily in search of people willing to be his friends.	?edit2=2_ABaOnucX2dgR5hg-StvokrMO2lsOudsskYK349IOvPxBtN1ya8IlJPAEw1o-K3PPVpLOwHU	Active	\N	\N	He might actually be really smart, but just plays dumb in order to hide it.|He's scared of ghosts.

Hia favorite places to gain the pudge is his rear, belly, and chest. There are times where the Lugia dons on a diaper of his own coloration, these moments are not often, but he does enjoy the soft feeling. He indeed likes some grosser topics, though there are some limitations on them just like a lot of other topics. Honesty is what he seeks when talking to others, liking to be well informed on things rather than have a false story to spare his feelings. There is a lot more he likes, and honestly would take a very very long time. To sum the rest up in quick fashion he is mostly a flex kind of person, able to adjust to what others want or need.	He dislikes any means of harm; as in torn limbs, cuts, killing, etc. Most bodily wastes are not his forte, however he does like it when he does it himself, rather contradictory, Having the bodily wastes on him from others. Being unable to do things on his own.	His personality is a strange one at that, he can get rather carried away with what he is doing. Mostly his anger and distaste in things. Other than that, he is normally one to stand over others and attempt to make it as he is the better person. At times disregarding others in the stretch. What makes it all the more complicated is that he is rather selfless when it comes to others, putting his life in harm's way to save others when it is absolutely necessary. The Lugia also tends to think to himself more than talk with anyone, mostly stuck in deep trains of thought than talking about the latest things. But be warned, he can get a little too energetic when around others. To the point he barely makes any sense.	\N	\N	?edit2=2_ABaOnudcxkuoxSPhF1Zi7aZcepAd6eC3OYhUNk6sOgbQcDQiZyaC-UKG7SIVitwdr0hOGIM	Active	\N	\N	His body conducts electricity, but at a cost of mobility.|His gender is actually female.|He left behind people to seek personal riches.|He crushed someone underneath him one time|His cooking can be considered decent at best	\N	\N	\N	f

He also tends to enjoy deep cleanings and scrubbings, despite his slobby tendencies.	Loud noises, tight spaces, and fighting in general. Cake tends to dislike feelings of obligation, despite not necessarily being disloyal. He also tends to get exceptionally terrible belly aches when his bulletproof GI tract fails on him.

He's not as tight with his own personal boundaries as some, but is quick to realize when he may be overstepping them.	Cake was a Charmander, son of a baker, who ran off to help his father find some apples in the woods. He managed to get lost in an unknown part of the woods, but eventually came to a tree harboring perfect apples. Afraid of heading back, thinking that he'd have to go through the dungeon once again, he stayed there for years, his belly-stretching diet of fruits helping him grow into a massive beast as he made the natural orchid his home, spending long days clearing the trees of apples. It wasn't until years later that he was discovered and led out of the forest, but unwilling to leave the apples, he settled in a mound on the edge of the woods. He made a living putting his parents skills to use, gathering fruits and baking goods for profit and feasting, however he found himself rather lonely, joining the guild to meet new friends.	Unlike most 'zards, Cake has a navel and finds it sensitive.	?edit2=2_ABaOnufE5-QuZeDQ5SLSambrgX9qvpy9Tyn_R0-hbOUEEy9WKLtgytJrdnIa2ImBjYEU4Fs	Active	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	\N	f

Although, despite her upbringing, she seems to prefer the company of free spirited people who live life to the beat of their own drum rather than adhering to societal expectation.	She grew up the prized daughter of a rather eccentric family. Expectations of her were high... too high for her to handle. She felt like at every turn, she couldn't live up to what everyone wanted her to be, causing her to gain self esteem issues. Over time, the problems built up, smothering her until she could find an outlet... which she did, in the form of a local gang of troublemakers and delinquents. It was your typical good girl/bad boy situation, as cliche as it sounds.  She found it relaxing to be around people who, not only didn't expect a thing from her, but also didn't seem to care about living up to expectations in general. No more of the overly formal nonsense for appearances, she could just be herself. Eventually, one of the members of that gang made plans with her to run away together.

He's a gentle spirit who will often try to find peaceful solutions rather than fighting, for better or for worse. His nature leads to him getting taken advantage of a lot, but it's very likely he actually loves being taken advantage of. He's overall a carefree guy who believes life is just about doing what makes you happy.	Deco was a young Smeargle with a relatively nice life. He got picked on sometimes, but nearly everyone goes through that kind of thing. He had a relatively standard life... though he got a little bored of it over time. He tried to ignore these abnormal desires in his heart, because he was always taught to believe they weren't normal. Though suppressing them didn't do much to make him feel better. He eventually came to the conclusion that... well, if they aren't hurting anyone, why not just embrace it? Life's too short to live by everyone else's standard of 'normal'. The Smeargle decided he wanted to become an adventurer in the kinkiest region known, Zaplana, in order to satisfy this itch that had been bothering him for so long. His reasons for becoming an explorer are as simple as... well, he wanted to! So here he is, ready to give it his all.	\N	?edit2=2_ABaOnuefl5pSxTzrkYnjliF0VizTCd_xt0rHU7uKpzMIaoR650ws74JID9vX-g5EEazYTzs	Active	\N	\N	Is an exceptionally bad cook|Is a real freak and a masochist behind that cute face|Was the runt of his family|Has an absurdly strong immune system|Once stopped a potential war	\N	\N	\N	f

He takes good care of pokemon he considers friends. But his top priority is always inciting and encouraging gluttony.	Draxton was a born and incredibly timid, shy Cacnea. He grew up in a small farm town, living a rather mundane, boring life. He felt his life dull, uninspired, and thought himself spineless and cowardly. Eventually, his desire for something more finally drove him to action. When he was old enough, he left his home to be a wanderer and rebrand his identity. He swapped out his quiet, timid nature to act as a cocky, mysterious flirt. Now he explores the region, wanting to see every little corner of this world around him under a new identity.  Visiting towns, seeing sights, and meeting pokemon. His goal is to leave his mark on every little corner of the world he can. He refuses to settle down anywhere until he's sure he's seen everything there is to see in this region he calls home.	\N	?edit2=2_ABaOnucUL9BS_gQwUe6B36ca7oy4Q9VsTt62F5IOxzK99rv-lxYfbOnjKwUvWVL6D-KR0z0	Active	\N	\N	He has voodoo powers|He has an affinity with nature due to his grass typing|He is actually incredibly lonely but hides it behind a confident facade|He secretly likes being put in his place and/or teased by attractive, dominant pokemon|He actually has a bounty on his head in more than a couple towns	\N	\N	\N	f

Constant Social Interaction, Dishonesty, the status quo for it’s own sake, social niceties, and closed mindedness.	Hugo values rationality and effectiveness which, for him, is usually an expression of order. He likes to screen things through the dual filters of, Is there proof? and then, Does it work? Nothing is above scrutiny nor beyond revision. However, this efficient rationality comes with a price. The Greninja isn't always aware of the feelings and emotional needs of others, and he often doesn't know what to do with his own. He's an independent thinker that can develop some pretty unique solutions, often finding he accomplishes this best when working alone. Hugo typically separates the effective from the ineffective pretty quickly. This allows him to plan effective strategies and tactics in both combat and everyday life. He deeply scrutinizes and handily organizes a concept's diverse parts, demonstrating love for systems and delight in using them to develop results-oriented approaches.	\N	Often, his ideas are fresh and different. If the perspective of others obeys the laws or rationality and logic, he's open to them as he is ever curious. The fat frog appreciates and is even drawn to at times, new and unfamiliar concepts. Hugo will hold firmly to the reality that good results are the product of hard work and persistence. He never loses sight of his goal, and this fuels his drive to push to greater efforts. Despite all these strengths, the fat frog's approach to life is challenging in its own right. He can get lost in a problem that can't be easily solved, will question things relentlessly, and often will not be satisfied with a 'good enough' answer. He's as likely to feel deeply as anyone else, but attending and expressing his emotions can be difficult for him. As well, he experienced discomfort when others express theirs.	?edit2=2_ABaOnucSbReucnm7Zh8MRGlGFSLObBI2XaHD-LLzBh1nDTSeZBZtUgpIhIRdmV2ooUmZuwQ	Active	\N	\N	I think he eats other Pokemon!

Cramped spaces, bitter flavors, extreme temperatures, cloudy (but not rainy) weather, rude people, actual life-or-death fights, making people mad.	Akari has never particularly been known as a natural skeptic; as long as you make it sound somewhat logical, you could probably get him to believe most anything. He tries to be friendly as possible and, despite his supposedly short temper, isn’t one to resort to violence unless he really doesn’t have a choice.\nExcept a sparring match or playfight, of course. The Serperior has always been up for fun and games.\nUnlike the typical image of a brave guild member, Akari does have a fully functioning sense of fear. If there is a threat to his life and there is noone to help him, the Serperior is liable to freeze up or immediately flee.	If he had grown up in Zaplana - and he always wishes he had - that would’ve been fine. Such a quirk would not have affected his life in the slightest. Unfortunately, he was not raised in Zaplana - he was raised in Unova. Growing up, Akari faced a lot of bullying - practically every kind until he evolved into a Servine. At that point, it had degraded (upgraded?) to just the various verbal insults that middle schoolers can come up with. Finally, he became a Serperior during his last couple years of schooling, at which time he got to enjoy a reprieve due to being a roughly 27 foot long snake (who actually had to take classes outside)… or he would’ve, if he ever stopped trying to protect other people, or even actually fought back.	Akari - as you can tell by a single glance - has never been a particularly normal Pokemon. Aside from the unique colors that stand out like a sore thumb, Akari is also quite, well, big. Not macro, mind you, but almost double - if you want to get precise, perhaps up to two and a half times - the size of the normal Serperior. Needless to say, Akari was relieved when he got out of school - he took a ferry to Zaplana, seeking out the normalcy of difference in the region. Not knowing if he’d do well in a city home, he decided to just wander around the forests, exploring and meeting new people… Besides, who needs a house?	?edit2=2_ABaOnucS2dvfcJfCU8HTcZZ7Jxxe8shrix13x4edh030pEu8ACy1Y05xNXnxkUUkXZ964Xs	Inactive	\N	\N	"I'm pretty sure he's some sort of pacifist - I've never seen him hit anyone, even if they were attacking him." | "I heard his parents were both sixty feet tall!

258	473547751221886976	Hana	Serperior	Grass	19	160 lbs	11'11	Female	Bisexual	Single	Leaf Blade | Leaf Storm | Slam | Wrap	Open/fresh air, battles of most varieties, spicy foods, warm and even hot temperatures, lakes, both sunny and rainy days, thunder, new things and people, helping people and those who need it, hide and seek, being up in the trees, self improvement, having company or at least background noise, being challenged.	Enclosed spaces, people who remind her of her mother or those who bullied her as a Snivy, colder temperatures, cloudy weather that doesn't bring rain or thunder, being alone in near-complete silence, being unable to move, sweets, realizing she can't beat something.	Always a hardworking snake, Hana has never been one to turn down a task she was given a good reason to undertake. She is unlikely to give up unless her goal proves genuinely impossible. As such, she has always worked toward becoming stronger and better at handling herself. She is spurred on by several events of her childhood; namely her overbearing mother and the other young ‘mons who bullied her for a time. However, her mother’s seemingly eternal lack of satisfaction with Hana’s accomplishments led to her always being silently judgmental of herself.\nConsidering her nature, Hana has always refused to back down from a challenge. She fears very little, though this strength may stretch into the territory of flaws as she refuses to back down from a challenge she cannot overcome.\nHana, aside from everything else, is a very hyperactive gal. She cannot remain still for the life of her, always wanting to be moving or doing something, even if it’s just lightly tapping the very tip of her tail on the floor.	While her mother never became violent, the bullies at school certainly did. Of course, nothing hurt her any more than the insults did, tearing at her already fractured self-esteem. Over time, Hana decided to try and get as strong as she could. After all, the children who always got their laughs picking on her would always call her weak, so perhaps if she were stronger they would leave her alone. As she had hoped, most of the bullying stopped when she became the first pokemon in her class to evolve. Of course, one bully decided to test the waters a bit and try to confront the somewhat-large Servine in the halls. She was the last one to try.\nShe was the first child in her class to reach her second evolution, and she was the first teenager to reach her third evolution around her 14th birthday. Her mother never stopped demanding better of her, and finally the young shiny decided to leave Alola for a new place. She has not spoken to her mother since leaving; probably for the best.	Hana was born to a strong and caring father and a strong and - at the time - equally caring mother on the Melemele Island of Alola. Her father died of natural causes when she was still a young Snivy, however, and it was around then that her mother became determined to bring the absolute best out of her daughter. This culminated, for better or worse, in a mother that was never satisfied with what Hana could accomplish. This made the Snivy rather self-conscious, a trait that sticks with her to this day even if she never talks about it outside her mind.\nHana always carries a defunct pokeball that she found on the beach with her. She doesn't know what it really is, always calling it 'a little storage ball' that she turned into a necklace.	?edit2=2_ABaOnuficl8EWVljUTWoIfaoXVWQnmxe7FZPu4fwCasMtBLtSuxVZKUfeLrIh6tHrCCRltw	Active	\N	\N	Didn't she beat someone within an inch of their life back when she was in school? | Eh, I doubt that, but I heard anyone who liked to tease people fell silent when they saw her. | Well, after she evolved, I could see that. She could probably beat a legendary if she wanted to! | I dunno, that's a bit of a stretch. She's definitely strong, though - hasn't she been training since she was pretty young? | Yeah, but she's also pretty fond of battling. I heard she was at the top of her high school's battling team!	\N	\N	\N	t

Daihana was never exactly a fighter, despite the appearance of her species. Sure, she trained a bit - she did what she had to to become a Nidorina, and then sort of stopped. After all, she much preferred the pursuit of learning stuff. A lot of stuff. She’s sort of a jack of all trades, and carries tools for most needs, but one should not rely on her for battling in any serious extent - she hasn’t trained for such a thing.\nDespite her ineptitude with combat, Daihana has a bit of a short temper, and smaller mons should be aware: low attack or not, getting smacked across the face by the hand of a Nidoqueen still hurts quite a bit.\nDaihana is a bit of an impatient pokemon, which is a bit ironic considering she hates being rushed.	Daihana was born a young female Nidoran in the area of Fuschia City, Kanto. She was raised and schooled there, a time during which she did her only combative training to date and later evolved into a Nidorina. She spent most of her time studying various things, and knows quite a lot for it; this at least helps her make up for her glaring lack of battle ability.\nShe eventually moved away from Fuschia City and to Unova for her time in university. She got a job as a software engineer there and remained for roughly six years. After becoming a Nidoqueen, she eventually decided to move again, to see what the newly discovered region of Zaplana had to offer.	Her full name is Katsuko Daihana.	?edit2=2_ABaOnudvnT39KJez8STP9U8VBERsiuG5GiWUkuSjpIVRPNg0BBuyRpCxpB-szeBqrb7qyys	Inactive	\N	\N	"I'm pretty sure she doesn't know how to fight.

Avery… is a mixture of things, really. They were shy and nervous after leaving the solitude of their forest den, though nowadays they seem a lot more confident in themselves. Almost too confident… it’s a wonder they haven’t gotten themselves hurt. Avery is some degree of affectionate, and loves to cuddle and play, though he might be a bit… protective.\nThey are willing to do anything to protect those they call a friend, whether that be through battle or through other means. Generally battle, of course; Avery fancies themselves a superior combatant, and tends to give an (adorable) threatening glare to anyone that claims otherwise.	Avery was born in a small family of Eevees and Evoloxxes deep in the woods near the Village. They… was always fond of the moon, and trained throughout their kithood to become an Umbreon. They somewhat got their wish, and matured into a Sylbreon. They were born with the apparent ability to switch between sexes at will, which was the source of quite a lot of teasing from their siblings - this only served to push Avery to trying to become as strong as possible.\nOf course, his ability led to his father abandoning the family shortly after birth, though all Avery remembers of that day was that his mother had a notable scar on her cheek from that day onward.\nEventually, Avery left the forest and found the village, where he learned about DJ Thunder and was soon stuck in the library, trying to learn how to program and operate a computer - he was inspired by the Jolteon, and ended up as the cybersecurity expert in the Guild.	His ability is **LUNAR CIRCLE** which brings temporary and localized nightfall to the battlefield. All poison, dark, and ghost damage receives a 10% boost and gravity is reduced. (The reduction of gravity undos moves such as Smack Down and grants a 10% speed boost to flying-types upon entering the battle.) The Sylbreon is healed by 5% (rounding up) each turn.\n\nOther than that, the story about his father can be found @ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fzAvUcG9KsygBJTbdu-aHRoKNV8AObmEE59kjiZT8gg/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHis character document in it's entirety can be found @ https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rNgJxp_6FDfz0GkX1qQWxBDSPsa3ZQiCF0D7d-fdMtQ/edit?usp=sharing	?edit2=2_ABaOnuew7s9Hw7EwXYL_6k2DAfRTMpGTlSQzJPy1FhuS0IY_xT8vCe1ThV2qryfZIEuN2Vw	Active	\N	\N	"D'ya think he's related to that Umbreon that came out of the woods a little over a decade ago?" | "Huh?

Getting wet, sweets, those who threaten Yin must be destroyed, fleeing, being ordered around, his one and only fear: Beedrill, cowards.	Yang has long had a habit of failing to distinguish between the traits of ‘brave’ and ‘stupid.’ He seems to fear relatively little, and has probably given Death’s doorstep a few more pokes than any young Vulpix ever should. Many less-than-innocent ‘mons have gone after him for his shininess, since shiny pelts tend to sell for more in less open markets. Yet, he has done a very good job of protecting his little sisters throughout the years, though the youngest, Yin, still stays with him to modern days. He also, of course, has a nature of never giving up. Like, ever.	Yang and his sisters, Yin and Weiji, were born in the mountainous areas of Zaplana to unknown parents. Yang and Weiji were the first born, and Weiji was essentially the voice of reason to her brother’s usually dangerous antics. When Yin was born later on, their mother died after of unexpected bloodloss, leaving Yang and Weiji to parent Yin.

There, she was subject to their hedonistic, magical torments what feels like forever... until she was finally released by one of the cult's own members.

H much prefers to play and have fun with others, finding it good that other pokemon should have time to just do whatever and have fun. He can be a bit greedy at times and sometimes will do almost anything to get shiny things which can include money. This linoone is also a bit of a glutton and most of the time can be found stuffing himself with berries he finds from pudgeberry forest. Despite his naughty nature he will go out of his way to help others if they need his assistance. However, he is very quick to underestimate or overestimate others he himself is not familiar with.	This linoone had for most of his life lived in a forest that is a long way from the village. For most of his life he had been a fun loving linoone who had on occasion snacked alot on various sweets. When reaching the age of 17 he had left his home in search of his own place to live while also promising to write back to his family. For almost a year he had wandered around the lands in search of a lace he could call home. None of the places he had visited seemed to intrest him. Upon coming across pudgeberry forest the linoone was suprised at how fattening the local berries were when compared to his home. Not only that | the berries were so delicous that it had conviced the linoone to stay here. Not long after coming across the forest he would find the village and with that would make himself a resisdent of said village. His little home would be right on the edge of pudgeberry forest along with it being a bit closer to obe city and with that he would help out the village from time to time.

Because of the move's nature, it has an easier time landing critical strikes and can cause bleeding.)|Rest	Kind fellows, exploring the world, a good fight, napping under the sunshine, delicious food, being big, lazying about.	Mean people, things going wrong, arguing with friends, seeing a friend hurt, being taunted for his weight, failing to accomplish something.	He's a mix-bag, calm and reserved but energetic and playful, often stubborn and hot headed. Kind and friendly, he's quite shy to those he meets, but you'll find he's a good friend to have around once you get to know him well. He gets quite serious when things don't look good, however. He's quite a gluttonous vee compared to others, which lead to him being overall bigger.	Little is known about him as we speak as he didn't share much details about his past or himself, although it's assumed that he lived a good kithood due to his overall optimist and tolerant nature. Not to mention, how large he has grown in his young years in comparison to others of his species. Still, there are some details about him that are known. Ever since his early days, he's been already exploring the world as soon as he was only a few weeks old, quickly learning how to survive and becoming who he is today. Taking on the dangerous life of an explorer and making a living out of exploration and discovery of dungeons, ruins, sacred places, among other things. If anything stood out from the details known, is that he was given a 'second chance' at life after an unfortunate demise in the hands of a beast and reborn as the Veeon he is now. Having sacrificed himself to save the life of another and giving them a chance to run for safety. This is, however, up for discussion whether or not it is true...	"Yes, yes I know I'm fluffy! I'm a Leareon for god's same!". He's capable of performing actions similarly to Leafeons and Flareons, such as floofing up to liberate excess heat or creating food for himself via photosynthesis and generate oxygen in the process. Surprisingly enough, his leaves can catch on fire if he wishes to do it, and at will. This allows him to deal fire and grass damage in conjunction during a fight. His leaves are resilient against the intense heat of the fire, due to his dual typing. His body is capable of sprouting vines and use then for a variety of things, these grassy limbs can be seen growing from his leafy, fluffy collar or from the cluster of leaves that grows on his fore legs and on his back. He has far more than a couple abilities than you'd expect from an Eeveelution, having Flash Fire and Guts from Flareon, and Leaf Guard and Chlorophyll from Leafeon.  He also has a few abilities of his own, but there's little information on what they actually are and what they do...	?edit2=2_ABaOnudZ-vi1kl9u_1Xxcc1LAxA1xgE0rCQKeWd-w1KAQpzsQRkBYDyEcTcO2Bq-mq3Ob8A	NPC	Lianvee's character, do not rp	The Village	He's an astonishingly resilient and durable Leareon, capable of shrugging off even the heaviest of hits.

Due to her past, the best way to make her angry is to practice or support slavery, or proclaim any sort of heresy against Arceus. She also hates the rich and influential.	Her upbringing has affected her to her core, as much as she hates to admit it. She’s still fascinated by the idea of hedonism... of eating whatever she wants to eat, doing whatever she wants to do, and messing with whoever ticks her off! But why would she be volunteering at a guild like this, then? Well, the more Pokemon get to know her, the more it becomes clear she has a bit of a soft side. A side that desperately wants to leave her past behind her, and dedicate herself to the cause of helping other Pokemon. She just simply can’t help it if she gets a little ‘distracted’ along the way. After all, there are so many cute faces out there in need of sitting on! She enjoys messing with other Pokemon, possibly by gulping them down or making use of terrible stench, or maybe by inflicting powerful curses upon them, which usually entail some sort of transformation.	Adriana learned of the nature of power during an otherwise… unfortunate upbringing. She was born to the cult of the Sylvan - a group who believes that the universe came about through natural processes, rather than being created by Arceus. While they were a scientifically minded group at first, the inherent nihilism of their philosophy led them down the path to hedonism and decadence, even resorting to enslaving other Pokemon so they could focus on their hedonism. Part of her loved the lifestyle… but there was some part of her, buried deep, deep down, that desperately cried out to her to do good. It all came to a head when, one night, she broke open the cages, freeing every slave at the encampment, before disappearing into the night, leaving her old life behind. Of course, the curses of the Sylvan continue to haunt her...	If you pull on one of her tails, you will immediately be transformed.

Coming from the Galar region, this young Obligatory Galar Starter came to Zaplana seeking... to taste all sorts of food the region has to offer... Yeah right! We all know he just came to be kinky with everyone! I bet he's just jealous of all the other pokémon in Galar getting to dynamax in front of everyone and came here to do it on his own!	Weak Point: Girls (He's a shy guy)	?edit2=2_ABaOnucmfNBpk23WzATdl3QBvtPEInXzWp2o9bLaUW6qiUsOEy-_p1WJkaqs9fPX0tJvqcE	Active	\N	\N	The only reason he's even here is because of the abundance of Dynamax Pills. He gets a high from it and is willing to do many things to get his hands on them. | Wasn't his mom a baker somewhere in Galar or something? I think he makes pies too. | I heard he never had a father figure. ...What? You wanted rumors, right? Who cares where I heard this!	. . . (He'd rather not say. He's not from Zaplana.)	He will not hesitate to go away as soon as you look at him funny.	\N	t
305	260677346351120384	Jonathan Lakyia Bumi	Buizel	Water	A lot, apparently?	2'06"	79 lbs (67 lbs without his, uh, features)	Male	Heterosexual	Single	Aqua Jet | Surf | Ice Punch | Aqua Ring	Cooking, Nemol berries, combat, making potions ~~instead of actually training with his moves~~, making friends and munching on a bunch of weird garbage with his tail maws! (nobody knows why theyre there he says it was from a potion but he refuses to share he might be lying)	Being told what to do, nightmares, little kids (he has no clue what to do with them), people he deems close-minded and being interviewed.	Usually very talkative and willing to go to far lengths to achieve things for his friends, be them whoever they might be. He used to be a wimp, but now he feels confident and ready to take on the world! (i had no idea what to write here is this good)	Coming from the far off land of Devuar, he came to this region to... I don't know. He says he came to make potions and stuff, but I never really see him do that at all. Do you think he just came for the island's infamy or something?	Apparently Jon has a bunch of kids. Anthro buizel girl, whimsicott girl, braixen boy, and... He always avoids the question when asked.\nHe also has big jaws on each end of his split tail. He didn't have those when he got here, and he barely talks about it. He seems to like having them though.\n\n(Visually he's a recolor with a hairdo, green floatie and green fins and the rest is just default buizel. I would've added the images but I'm too lazy to make new ones right now.  I'll add them later.)	?edit2=2_ABaOnufpyUDALLi6Rnif3etrqKJDVsIaP_Nzd53eoBCzrZZ5t1xtfcQ8IVcYnHc_Jmie_74	Active	\N	\N	I heard that his confidence is all an act. I bet he's real lonely inside and just doesn't wanna let people see it. | Didn't that dork used to have a bunch of wives? One after the other, they kept finding him and now they're dead... This guy's a murderer! | Doesn't he stay at home all day? I remember seeing him doing kinky stuff to himself and almost always on his own. I wonder why he hides it...	The region of Devuar! (dont ask where it is)	His tail maws have a mind of their own? At least he says that, probably to get away with chomping onto people he likes using them. Whatever it is, be careful with those.	\N	t
306	260677346351120384	MissingNo.	Unintentional Shapeshifter	Normal	QkVZT05ES0FOVE8=	Varies (22.1 lbs - 3507.1 lbs)	Varies (3'3" - 10'0")	N/A	N/A	N/A	Water Gun | Water Gun | Sky Attack | Bind	Talking. Looking at the rest of the world silently. The sea. The colors purple and yellow.	Being touched. The greedy and selfish. Stadiums. The colors yellow and red.	Rarely speaks... Apparently, if people seek it, it will try to speak to them about how they've been neglected for so long. They are usually very calm, but will not hesitate to point out the stupidity in other's desires with it.	\N	Its legendary abilities spoken of in hushed tones on playgrounds all over the world, M y̨y͝ｙｙｙ͞ｙｙｙｙｙｙ̀ｙｙｙｙｙｙ̸ｙ͢ｙ͜y͜yy̡y̛ye҉yeąyeay͘e̡a̴ye͡ay̢eày̸eayea͢yea̡y̴he̕a͝y͝h̀e͢ay͡he͞ay̢h͏ȩa͢yḩe͞ay͜he̕ayheayh\nCan duplicate items. Can change a pokémon's typing temeporarily. Bird-type and Normal-type.\n\n(NOTE the image used isnt supposed to be the *correct* way to interpret its looks or anything, be creative with it and please dont make him a just flat png thank you)	?edit2=2_ABaOnufVltUDP24Uu6donzGi4ogFjIigzjVGBI1nxAPNuBXlXSBGrmEAEw4HPpi116MyrWI	NPC	It isn't omnipotent, but it is fair to say it knows a lot about other characters. (a meta explanation could be it has access to the rotombot, haha dont do that actually) If you plan on making it look like something other than a distortion, a substitute doll, a generic ghost, a kabutops fossil or an aerodactyl fossil, try using something that is familiar to whoever is witnessing MissingNo., like an old toy they liked as a kid or a good friend of theirs. Don't be afraid to ask the other player about a good option in DMs!\nThey've been alone for a long time since their... rebirth. Try to keep its origins vague and misleading, because no matter what you come up with someone is going to be mad about it not being the origin story they thought was cooler. It usually doesn't expect people to talk to it or fight it, accostumed to the idea of everyone running away from it. It's willing to do favors for others, but it usually comes at some sort of price, like a very valuable item or a part of their being or something.	Calming Coast? Styx Mountain? There's only rumors about its whereabouts...	I remember my pappy told me once about a kangaskhan's baby that was left all alone in the wild and found its way up Styx Mountain. All the ghosties guided it up there, and it eventually died there all alone. But, it was too willing to cling to the realm of the living, and its soul remained in the distorted form that was what everyone talks about now... But that's not real, right? Ghosts aren't real! Only ghost-type pokémon are real! | You know, that thing reminds me a lot of the times I've went to the Dream Shrine near Calming Coast. Do you think it might've come from there into our world somehow? | YOU IDIOT! IT'S GONNA KILL US ALL IF WE BRING IT HERE! DON'T TALK TO IT, NO MATTER WHAT IT SAYS!	Cinnabar Island, Kanto	Talking to it will make you feel funny. It also might distort your vision of the world into something more relaxing, like a view of the ocean, though its instability with this plane of existence will end up distorting this vision as well. He means no harm, and the world around you is exactly the way it was, but do keep this in mind if you look for it.\nOther effects may include feeling the weather change drastically from one random state to the next, struggling to remember what it is that you're doing, blacking out and somehow interpreting the sun or the moon as another pokémon.
